### About the design

## Nemoâ€™s Ice Cream
This is a design for a fictional ice cream shop inspired by Finding Nemo. The goal is to create a warm and welcoming experience with subtle marine elements.

### The Design

#### Color palette

Color palette is inspired by the clownfish and a calm ocean, and consists of soft colors such as orange, creamy white, a warm dark brown and a calm dark blue.

#### Page Structure
- The homepage represents the **ocean surface**.
- Scrolling down takes the user **underwater** to the product page.
- At the bottom is the footer, symbolizing the **ocean floor**.

#### Shapes and Layout
The vision is to mimic the shapes of the ocean. There's shapes representing waves and round shapes representing bubbles. The angular, blue buttons balance the round shapes create a clear contrast, and the cute sea creature illustrations create a welcoming feel for all ages!

The fonts are easy to read, with a more playful style for the logo to make it stand out.
The design is quite sudtle, since we have focused on the the atmosphere and feeling of the ocean, rather than obvious marine elements.
